# Collapse Menu ChatGPT

To optimize your working space on ChatGPT, it is recommended to collapse the menu bar. By doing so, you can enjoy a more expansive and unrestricted area for your work. When hovering over the left side of the screen, the menu bar will smoothly expand, revealing its contents. Once you're done with the menu, simply move your cursor away, and it will seamlessly collapse back. This user-friendly interaction not only maximizes your workspace but also ensures a clutter-free environment, allowing you to focus on your tasks and interactions within ChatGPT.
